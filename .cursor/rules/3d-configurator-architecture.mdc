# 3D Configurator & Babylon Engine

The 3D configurator is a thin rendering shell over the canonical parametric state
and pricing engines. It must never become the source of truth.

## 1. Separation of Concerns

- **State of record**:
  - The canonical configuration state lives in the parametric kernel and backend
    services (`services/param-kernel-service`, `services/configurator-session-service`).   
- The Babylon scene (`packages/3d-engine`) is a **projection** of that state:
  - It may hold view-only state (camera, selection, hover, gizmos).
  - Structural changes must always result from a parametric delta applied via BFF.

## 2. Interaction Flow

- User interactions (drag, add/remove cabinet, change option) must:
  1. Compute a **parametric delta** (no imperative geometry edits).
  2. Call the BFF via tRPC to apply the delta (which calls the kernel + CPQ). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
  3. Receive an updated canonical state + constraint summary + price changes.
  4. Re-render the Babylon scene from the updated state.
- No direct DB or pricing logic inside 3D engine or React components.

## 3. Performance Rules

- Target **60 FPS**:
  - Main-thread JS work per frame ≤ 3–4 ms.
  - Heavy geometry work must be offloaded to Web Workers and/or WASM.
- Use:
  - Instancing for repeated cabinet meshes.
  - LODs or simplified meshes for distant geometry.
  - Pre-baked static meshes for walls/fixed structure.

## 4. Embeddable SDK

- `packages/configurator-sdk` exposes a stable host API:
  - `init(container, tenantId, locale, authToken, callbacks...)`.
- All host integrations (dealer sites, B2C flows) must:
  - Use the SDK API instead of reaching into internal React/Babylon APIs.
  - Treat configuration IDs and project IDs as opaque references.
